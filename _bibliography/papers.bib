  abstract={Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models for high-quality image generation. The VAR architecture generates visual tokens in a coarse-to-fine, scale-by-scale manner, which sets it apart from traditional raster-order autoregressive models. However, the inner mechanism behind VAR model's effectiveness is under-explored. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on VAR: we show that VAR models can be viewed through the lens of discrete diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that VAR's generative process is functionally equivalent to a scale-wise discrete masked diffusion process, with slight variation in the learning objective. In this framework, VAR's next-scale predictions correspond to masked token recovery in a multi-scale latent space. Our findings reveal a deep connection between autoregressive visual generation and diffusion processes, offering new theoretical insights and opening the door for further exploration of hybrid generative architectures.},

  abstract={
Diffusion models have emerged as a formidable tool for training-free conditional
generation. However, a key hurdle in inference-time guidance techniques is the
need for compute-heavy backpropagation through the diffusion network for estimating the guidance direction. Moreover, these techniques often require handcrafted
parameter tuning on a case-by-case basis. Although some recent works have introduced minimal compute methods for linear inverse problems, a generic lightweight guidance solution to both linear and non-linear guidance problems is still missing.
To this end, we propose Dreamguider, a method that enables inference-time guidance without compute-heavy backpropagation through the diffusion network. The
key idea is to regulate the gradient flow through a time-varying factor. Moreover,
we propose an empirical guidance scale that works for a wide variety of tasks,
hence removing the need for handcrafted parameter tuning. We further introduce
an effective lightweight augmentation strategy that significantly boosts the performance during inference-time guidance. We present experiments using Dreamguider
on multiple tasks across multiple datasets and models to show the effectiveness of
the proposed modules. To facilitate further research, we will make the code public

  abstract={
Recently, diffusion transformers have gained wide attention with the
release of SORA from OpenAI, emphasizing the need for transformers as backbone for diffusion models. Transformer-based models have shown better generalization capability compared to CNN-based models for general vision tasks.
However, much less has been explored in the existing literature regarding the capabilities of transformer-based diffusion backbones and expanding their generative prowess to other datasets. This paper focuses on enabling a single pre-trained
diffusion transformer model to scale across multiple datasets swiftly, allowing for
the completion of diverse generative tasks using just one model. To this end, we
propose DiffScaler, an efficient scaling strategy for diffusion models where we
train a minimal amount of parameters to adapt to different tasks. In particular,
we learn task-specific transformations at each layer by incorporating the ability
to utilize the learned subspaces of the pre-trained model, as well as the ability to
learn additional task-specific subspaces, which may be absent in the pre-training
dataset. As these parameters are independent, a single diffusion model with these
task-specific parameters can be used to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Moreover, we find that transformer-based diffusion models significantly outperform CNN-based diffusion models methods while performing fine-tuning over
smaller datasets. We perform experiments on four unconditional image generation datasets. We show that using our proposed method, a single pre-trained
model can scale up to perform these conditional and unconditional tasks, respectively, with minimal parameter tuning while performing as close as fine-tuning an
entire diffusion model for that particular task.},

surgical scene analysis using artificial intelligence. However, the inherent data scarcity in this domain makes it
challenging to adapt traditional segmentation techniques
for this task. To tackle this issue, current research employs
pretrained models and finetunes them on the given data.
Even so, these require training deep networks with millions
of parameters every time new data becomes available. A
recently published foundation model, Segment-Anything
(SAM), generalizes well to a large variety of natural images, hence tackling this challenge to a reasonable extent.
However, SAM does not generalize well to the medical
domain as is without utilizing a large amount of compute
resources for fine-tuning and using task-specific prompts.
Moreover, these prompts are in the form of boundingboxes or foreground/background points that need to be
annotated explicitly for every image, making this solution
increasingly tedious with higher data size. In this work,
we propose AdaptiveSAM - an adaptive modification of
SAM that can adjust to new datasets quickly and efficiently,
while enabling text-prompted segmentation. For finetuning
AdaptiveSAM, we propose an approach called bias-tuning
that requires a significantly smaller number of trainable
parameters than SAM (less than 2%). At the same time,
AdaptiveSAM requires negligible expert intervention since
it uses free-form text as prompt and can segment the object
of interest with just the label name as prompt. Our experiments show that AdaptiveSAM outperforms current stateof-the-art methods on various medical imaging datasets

  abstract={Although many long-range imaging systems are designed to support extended vision applications, a natural
obstacle to their operation is degradation due to atmospheric turbulence. Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur
and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep
learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversionbased, have been proposed in the literature which attempt
to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of
these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained
some traction because of their stable training process and
their ability to generate high quality images. In this paper,
we propose the first DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference
times for conditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are

    abstract={Conditional generative models typically demand large
annotated training sets to achieve high-quality synthesis.
As a result, there has been significant interest in designing
models that perform plug-and-play generation, i.e., to use
a predefined or pretrained model, which is not explicitly
trained on the generative task, to guide the generative
process (e.g., using language). However, such guidance
is typically useful only towards synthesizing high-level
semantics rather than editing fine-grained details as
in image-to-image translation tasks. To this end, and
capitalizing on the powerful fine-grained generative
control offered by the recent diffusion-based generative
models, we introduce Steered Diffusion, a generalized
framework for photorealistic zero-shot conditional image
generation using a diffusion model trained for unconditional
generation. The key idea is to steer the image generation
of the diffusion model at inference time via designing a
loss using a pre-trained inverse model that characterizes
the conditional task. This loss modulates the sampling
trajectory of the diffusion process. Our framework allows
for easy incorporation of multiple conditions during
inference. We present experiments using steered diffusion on
several tasks including inpainting, colorization, text-guided
semantic editing, and image super-resolution. Our results
demonstrate clear qualitative and quantitative improvements
over state-of-the-art diffusion-based plug-and-play models
while adding negligible additional computational cost.

over other generative models comes from the flexible internal structure of diffusion models. Since each sampling

  abstract={Modern-day surveillance systems perform person
recognition using deep learning-based face verification networks. Most state-of-the-art facial verification systems are
trained using visible spectrum images. But, acquiring images
in the visible spectrum is impractical in scenarios of low-light
and nighttime conditions, and often images are captured in
an alternate domain such as the thermal infrared domain.
Facial verification in thermal images is often performed after
retrieving the corresponding visible domain images. This is a
well-established problem often known as the Thermal-to-Visible
(T2V) image translation. In this paper, we propose a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based solution for
T2V translation specifically for facial images. During training,
the model learns the conditional distribution of visible facial
images given their corresponding thermal image through the
diffusion process. During inference, the visible domain image
is obtained by starting from Gaussian noise and performing denoising repeatedly. The existing inference process for
DDPMs is stochastic and time-consuming. Hence, we propose
a novel inference strategy for speeding up the inference time of
DDPMs, specifically for the problem of T2V image translation.
We achieve the state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

has been typically accomplished by estimating a crowddensity map and summing over the density values. However, this approach suffers from background noise accumulation and loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian
kernels to create the ground truth density maps. This issue
can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian kernel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when trained with
such ground truth density maps. To overcome this limitation, we propose using conditional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion models are known to model
complex distributions well and show high fidelity to training data during crowd-density map generation. Furthermore, as the intermediate time steps of the diffusion process are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the
feature learning. In addition, owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model, we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting performance
contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. Further, we also differ from the density summation and introduce contour detection followed by summation as the
counting operation, which is more immune to background
noise. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets

recognition and detection are performed on these images. In recent years, various deep learning-based atmospheric turbulence
mitigation methods have been proposed in the literature. These
methods are often trained using synthetically generated images
and tested on real-world images. Hence, the performance of these
restoration methods depends on the type of simulation used for
training the network. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the
effectiveness of various turbulence simulation methods on image
restoration. In particular, we evaluate the performance of two stateor-the-art restoration networks using six simulations method on a
real-world LRFID dataset consisting of face images degraded by
turbulence. This paper will provide guidance to the researchers
and practitioners working in this field to choose the suitable data
generation models for training deep models for turbulence mitigation. The implementation codes for the simulation methods, source
codes for the networks and the pre-trained models are available at

  abstract={Dual-lens (DL) cameras capture depth information,
and hence enable several important vision applications. Most
present-day DL cameras employ unconstrained settings in the two
views in order to support extended functionalities. But a natural
hindrance to their working is the ubiquitous motion blur encountered due to camera motion, object motion, or both. However,
there exists not a single work for the prospective unconstrained
DL cameras that addresses this problem (so called dynamic scene
deblurring). Due to the unconstrained settings, degradations in
the two views need not be the same, and consequently, naive
deblurring approaches produce inconsistent left-right views and
disrupt scene-consistent disparities. In this paper, we address this
problem using Deep Learning and make three important contributions. First, we address the root cause of view-inconsistency in
standard deblurring architectures using a Coherent Fusion Module. Second, we address an inherent problem in unconstrained
DL deblurring that disrupts scene-consistent disparities by introducing a memory-efficient Adaptive Scale-space Approach. This
signal processing formulation allows accommodation of different
image-scales in the same network without increasing the number
of parameters. Finally, we propose a module to address the
Space-variant and Image-dependent nature of dynamic scene
blur. We experimentally show that our proposed techniques have
substantial practical merit.},

  abstract={In recent years, deep neural network-based restoration methods have
achieved state-of-the-art results in various image deblurring tasks.
However, one major drawback of deep learning-based deblurring
networks is that large amounts of blurry-clean image pairs are required for training to achieve good performance. Moreover, deep
networks often fail to perform well when the blurry images and the
blur kernels during testing are very different from the ones used during training. This happens mainly because of the overfitting of the
network parameters on the training data. In this work, we present
a method that addresses these issues. We view the non-blind image
deblurring problem as a denoising problem. To do so, we perform
Wiener filtering on a pair of blurry images with the corresponding
blur kernels. This results in a pair of images with colored noise.
Hence, the deblurring problem is translated into a denoising problem. We then solve the denoising problem without using explicit
clean target images. Extensive experiments are conducted to show
that our method achieves results that are on par to the state-of-the-art
non-blind deblurring works.},

  abstract={Atmospheric turbulence can adversely affect the quality of images or videos captured by long range imaging systems. 
  Turbulence causes both geometric and blur distortions in images which in turn results in poor performance of the subsequent computer vision algorithms like
   recognition and detection. Existing methods for atmospheric turbulence mitigation use registration and deconvolution schemes to remove degradations.
    In this paper, we present a deep learning-based solution in which Effective Nearest Neighbors (ENN) based method is used for registration and an 
    uncertainty-based network is used for restoration. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons using synthetic and real-world datasets to
     show the significance of our work.},
