My internship work at Google,  <a href="https://scaling3dnvs.github.io/"><b>Scaling Transformer-Based Novel View Synthesis Models with Token Disentanglement and Synthetic Data</b></a>, was accepted at ICCV 2025. Our work scales up 3D reconstruction using synthetic data and achieves state-of-the-art results.
