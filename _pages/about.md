I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at VIU Lab , Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Vishal M Patel</a> .


I work on problems in Computer Vision. My research areas include Face recognition and Deep Generative Modelling with a special emphasis on Plug and Play models and efficient architectures for generation, enabling training and inference of generative models on low compute resources.



Prior to joining JHU, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's dual degree (B.Tech& M.Tech)  in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. At IIT Madras, I worked with  <a href='https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=jXTZEw4AAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr AN Rajagopalan</a> at the IPCV Lab, on image reconstruction. In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking.
