I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at VIU Lab , Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Vishal M Patel</a> .


I work on problems in computer vision. My research primarily focuses on Deep generative modelling.  With a special emphasis on plug and play models and efficient architectures for generation. Enabling training and Infrence of generative models on low compute resources.



Prior to joining JHU, I obtained a Bachelor's and Master's dual degree (B.Tech& M.Tech) with a major in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras , where I worked with  <a href='https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=jXTZEw4AAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr AN Rajagopalan</a> at the IPCV Lab, IIT Madras on Image reconstruction.



In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking.
