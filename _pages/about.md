I am a Research Engineer at Apple, where I develop agentic workflows for human interaction understanding. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, working under the supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Vishal M. Patel</a> at the VIU Lab. Prior to JHU, I obtained my dual degree (B.Tech & M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I conducted research on image reconstruction with <a href='https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=jXTZEw4AAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. A.N. Rajagopalan</a> at the IPCV Lab.

My PhD research focused on computer vision, with an emphasis on deep generative modeling. This included work on diffusion models, plug-and-play architectures, and efficient generation techniques for resource-constrained devices.

I find the theory behind diffusion models fascinating. Fun fact: the basics were proposed by Einstein! Over the past several years, I have contributed to advances in image, video, and 3D generation using these models. I welcome collaborations with researchers who share an interest in generative modeling. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:iamnithingk@gmail.com">reach out</a>.
