I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at VIU Lab , Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Vishal M Patel.</a>


I work on problems in Computer Vision. My research areas include Deep Generative Modelling using diffusion models with a special emphasis on Plug and Play models and efficient architectures for generation, enabling training and inference of generative models on low compute resources.



Prior to joining JHU, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's dual degree (B.Tech& M.Tech)  in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. At IIT Madras, I worked with  <a href='https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=jXTZEw4AAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr AN Rajagopalan</a> at the IPCV Lab, on image reconstruction. In my free time, I enjoy reading philosophical books, running and hiking.

A bit about myself. I was initially into analog integrated circuit design, and although I was good at it, I did not enjoy it much. That is when I found out about computer vision. A topic that was fun, I was good at and what the world wanted. Moving forward, I found the theory behind diffusion models fascinating. (Fun fact: The basics of diffusion were proposed by Einstein himself). I have been working with diffusion models for the past 3 years. This spans Image, Video and 3-D generation using diffusion models.

I'm always open to collaborations, if you are excited about diffusion models and want to work with me please feel free to reach out.

<span style="color: green;">I am looking for a research position in industry. Please reach out if you think I could be a good fit!</span>
